# Digital Filter Designer

## What is this project?

A filter design tool to help users design, and test various filters made using a minimum number of built-in functions.  
These filters consist of filter types: LowPass, Highpass, BandPass, BandStop  
These filters consist of filter designs: Butterworth, Chebyshev I, Moving Average, and Windowed-Sinc  
The required implementation uses offline processing, but an attempt at real time implementation is made.

## Capabilities of the design:

- User can choose to input an audio file OR record their own audio through a microphone 
  (over a specified time) to filter using the GUI

- All required digital filters are applicable to audio signals (FIR and the IIR filters)
	- Digital Filter Designs: Butterworth, Chebyshev I, Moving Average, Windowed-Sinc
		- User can select number of points for Moving Average and type of Windowed-Sinc
	- Filter Type: LowPass, HighPass, BandPass, BandStop

- The windows implemented for windowed-sinc function are: 
	- Rectanguler, Blackman-Harris, Kaisser and Hamming

- Software is able to plot the input signal, output signal and the
  filters time and frequency responses 

- User can filter response based on what filter minimum requirements they set
	- Filter Order, LowPass/HighPass Cut-Off, BandPass/BandStop Cut-Offs 
	- Set Order will set the order of the TF to change the frequency response of the filter

- Implemented Custom FFT function to calculate the frequency and 
  the phase response of the input and output signals (not highly delayed compared to built-in)

- User can record an Audio input, have it filtered, and output the filtered audio
  on plots and playback in Real-Time (1 second delay)

## Shortcoming of the design:

- Not able to get a full proper response for moving average's stopband filter

- Cutoff frequency is not used to calculate the points required for the moving average filter, 
  instead user is asked for the points/number of points they want to use

- When real-time recording takes place, it results in audio getting choppy due to
  recording 1 second intervals, as the interval time is increased, audio is less choppy,
  but the audio output/playback is then delayed by that increase 
  (we have set the recording intervals to 1 seconds)

- The signals are not plotted directly on the GUI, however they are still plotted and can be viewed

## Suggested Future Implementation:

- Display plot Visualizers on the GUI with ability to switch between the following  
	i. The input signal (Time and Frequency Response)  
	ii. The filterâ€™s frequency response  
	iii. The output signal (Time and Frequency Response)

- Decrease window size for real-time implementation (1 second to 0.1 second or less for reduced delay response)
  
- Implement Analog Filters, more window-sinc windows, and other missing filters such as Bessel, Chebyshev II, etc.

- Allow user to chose when to start/stop recording of audio rather than restricting them to a time limit
